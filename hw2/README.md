In this project we have relied on the Twitter4J library designed for Java to integrate and work with the Twitter API successfully. Twitter4J allowed our team to easily integrate the Twitter API calls to fetch information such as a user’s tweets, timeline, comments and even allow us the ability to update a user’s profile through code. Twitter4J made it simple for our team to work in a collaborative environment where we could then use Karaf to deploy our application successfully. A variety of eight different API calls are implemented throughout our project. Specifically, one of the API calls allows us to view the user’s twitter feed while another API call allows us to update the user’s profile picture. Moreover, the flexibility and ease with which the Twitter4J library allows us to easily connect to the user’s Twitter account helped to make this project a success.
